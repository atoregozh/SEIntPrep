Notes
Dear Data Engineer hiring manager,

Thank you for the challenge! I haven't used regexes before, but after some digging and research, I realized their strong power. For the Data Science class that I'm taking, I was working on an assignment where we were using python's Beautiful Soup library to parse the web pages, but seems like using regexes could be easier. Thanks for teaching me something new!

I also wanted to note that the regex for website would return 'no match' for Smitty’s Famous Fish and Chicken and Ambala Dhaba (in Los Angeles) because they don't have a website listed on Yelp's page. That regex works for all other restaurants though.

Thanks,
Aizhan
